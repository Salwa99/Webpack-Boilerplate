# Webpack-Boilerplate

## Desctiption:

In this exercise I built a simple yet powerful webpack boilerplate.
Webpack is a free and open-source module bundler for JavaScript. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
### Getting started:
**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Clone this file  from github**
**run**
  ```
  npm  i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader style-loader css-loader sass-loader html-webpack-plugin mini-css-extract-plugin
  ```
  After Installing all the packages run this command ``` npm start ``` to start dev server and run ``` npm run build ``` to creates a build directory with a production build of your app.
